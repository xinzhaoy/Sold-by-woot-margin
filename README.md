## Folder Explanation

- **dist folder**: Contains the compiled and minified code generated by the build process. These are the optimized files ready for production deployment. This folder is created when you run `npm run build`.

- **docs folder**: Used specifically for GitHub Pages deployment. This is a copy of the dist folder content that GitHub Pages serves directly from the repository. When deploying to GitHub Pages, the content of the dist folder is copied to the docs folder.
